        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="about__history">
            At the outset, there is nothing significant about the year 1721, as far as India's 
            political history is concerned. Aurangzeb, the sixth of the great Mughals, had passed 
            away in 1707, and the Empire he and his forefathers had built, had started to disintegrate. 
            The Marathas were gaining in prominence, and in the process of knocking hard on the doors of
            Delhi. These were prominent happenings; what was peripheral was that 'merchants' from England 
            and France had established 'settlements' in select areas of the subcontinent, and were going 
            about their business of trade. The sea-route being the sole link between them and their 
            respective homelands, most of these settlements were situated in the coastal areas of the Indian
            peninsula. It was sometime in 1721 that a British ship dropped anchor off the coast of 
            Kutch in western India. The recreational activities the sailors indulged in on
            the coast elicited curious reactions from onlookers. One of the sailors, who
            answered to the name of Downing, recalled his time on the Kutch coast in his 
            memoirs thus: "We everyday diverted ourselves with playing cricket and other 
            exercises".

            As the merchants metamorphosed into rulers, they continued to demonstrate their
            recreational pursuits on Indian soil.The British army took on the English settlers
            in what was the first recorded cricket match in India in 1751.          
            The establishment of the Calcutta Cricket Club (what we know today as CC & FC) in 1792,
            was another watershed for the sport in the land. In fact, it is the second-oldest cricket
            club in the world, after the MCC (1787).       
            Ten years after its inception, the CCC organized a match between its team and the Old Etonians.
            The highlight of the game was Old Etonian Robert Vansittart's hundred. It was the first 'recorded'
            century on Indian soil.That game was watched by the locals, as were other encounters that took place
            elsewhere. It was but natural that the locals sought to copy what the 'rulers' were doing. Recent evidence 
            suggests that members of the Indian army were among the first to take to the sport. The 'sepoys' of regiments
            based in Sylhet (now part of Bangladesh) were reported by a periodical of the time as being more energetic
            and cheerful cricketers than their European superiors. The latter did not mind this, and were in fact 
            happy to engage in matches against their subordinat. The Parsis were the first Indian civilian community to 
            take to cricket. They set up the Oriental Cricket Club in Mumbai in 1848. It did a premature death, 
            but the community then established the Young Zoroastrians Club in 1850.


            At the team's send-off in Bombay, Pherozeshah Mehta, one of the eminent Indians of the time, stated the squad's objective; 
            "As artists go to Italy to do homage to the Great Masters, or as pilgrims go to Jerusalem to worship at a shrine, so now 
            the Parsis are going to England to pay homage to the English cricketers, to learn something of that noble and manly pastime 
            in the very country that is cricket's chosen home. "As was expected, the Parsis could not get the better of their seasoned 
            opponents, but they gained a lot of experience. The second Parsi outfit that went to England in 1888 was far more confident
            than its predecessor. The visitors exceeded all expectations, winning eight matches, losing eleven, and drawing twelve. 
            Their most successful cricketer was the round-arm bowler Dr. Mehellasha Pavri, who took as many as 170 wickets.
            The British sent a team to India in 1889-90 under the captaincy of G.F. Vernon. The main aim of the team was to play 
            against Englishmen living in India. Critically from the Indian point of view, one game was scheduled against the Parsis, 
            in the light of their impressive showing in 1888. In what was a red-letter event for Indian cricket, the Parsis prevailed by 
            four wickets. It was the first cricket defeat suffered by the British on Indian soil, and indeed, their first 'defeat' of 
            any kind since they had crushed the War of Independence in 1857.

            However, while they were unremitting on the political front, the British were supportive on the sporting one. Lord Hawke's 
            team that toured India in 1892-93 made room for two matches against the Parsis, wherein the spoils were shared.
            Lord Harris, one of the game's influential figures of the time, did his bit in his capacity as Governor of the Bombay 
            Province to further Indian interest in cricket. He instituted an annual 'Presidency' match between the Europeans and the 
            Parsis, and also earmarked land on the Mumbai seafront, for the Parsis, Hindus and Muslims to set up their respective 
            'Gymkhanas' and 'maidans.'

            The game had by then spread across the subcontinent. It gained a fillip in the 1890s when the Prince of the state of 
            Nawanagar wowed all those in England who thronged to watch him bat. Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji was elegance personified on 
            the cricket field. His fascinating wristwork and unconventional shot-making skills were a revelation to the British, who 
            were born and bred on an orthodox approach. His success, first for Sussex in the English County Championship, and then 
            England in Test cricket, made him one of the most popular personalities in the Empire 'where the sun never set.'
            His fellow Princes were quick on the uptake. Some of them took it upon themselves to do their bit for cricket, to 
            facilitate their entry into the 'good books' of the British rulers.
            The 'princely' influence worked wonders for cricket in India, as did other parallel developments. The annual Presidency 
            match between the Europeans and the Parsis became a Triangular when the Hindus joined the fray in 1907. It became a 
            Quadrangular in 1912 with the entry of the Muslims. The Christians and Anglo-Indians came together to form a 'Rest' team 
            in 1937, thus making the annual event a Pentangular. The tournament was played till 1945-46, after which it was banned on 
            account of its communal overtones.
            1911 witnessed the first-ever tour of England by an 'All-India' team. Sponsored and captained by the Maharaja of Patiala, 
            the team featured the best cricketers of the time. The top performer was the left-arm spinner Baloo Palwankar, who bagged 
            over a hundred wickets. It was a memorable performance in more ways than one. A member of the so-called 'untouchable' 
            segment of the Hindu society, Baloo underwent many a reverse early in his life. However, merit eventually superseded all 
            the other factors, and Baloo went on to become the premier member of the Hindu side. He also captained them for a number 
            of years in the annual Quadrangular. An all-rounder from Nagpur made his first-class debut in the 1916 edition of 
            the tournament. He batted at no. 9 in his first game against the Europeans, and got off the mark with a six. As the 
            years passed, the young man gained prominence as a flamboyant batsman and inspirational captain.
            The outbreak of World War I prevented visits by cricket teams from England to India in the 1910s. It was in 1926, 
            eight years after the end of the War, that two representatives of the Calcutta Cricket Club travelled to London to 
            attend a couple of meetings of the Imperial Cricket Conference.
            Technically, the CCC should not have been allowed to participate in the meeting, as the club did not have exclusive 
            control over cricket in India. But the club had the blessings of Lord Harris, who was Chairman of the ICC at the time. 
            A significant outcome of the meeting was the MCC's decision to send a team to India in 1926-27. Arthur Gilligan, who
            
            had captained England in the 1924-25 Ashes, was assigned the captaincy of the team.
            The match between the visitors and the Hindus at the Bombay Gymkhana was made memorable by the man who had hit a six 
            on his first-class debut in 1916. C.K. Nayudu blasted thirteen boundaries and eleven sixes on the way to 153. 
            His century took him only hundred minutes to complete, and left the spectators delirious. Prof. D.B. Deodhar's 148 
            for 'All-India' in an earlier game, as also the showing of cricketers like J.G. Navle, Wazir Ali and Col. Mistry, 
            made a huge impression on the visiting captain. Gilligan was convinced that India was ready for Test cricket.
            By then, not only was cricket being played all over the subcontinent by the locals, but it had also scaled unforeseen 
            heights of popularity. An annual Presidency match between the Europeans and Indians had been instituted in Chennai 
            in 1915. It was played during the Pongal festivities. Sind, Calcutta, Lahore, Lucknow, Hyderabad and Kanpur were 
            among the other leading cricket centres on the subcontinent. The Maharaja of Patiala supervised the creation of 
            cricket arenas in Patiala and Chail, where he arranged for coaches from overseas to train junior cricketers.
            Gilligan was one of the active participants in a meeting in Delhi in February 1927. The Maharaja of Patiala, a 
            British businessman named Grant Govan, and Anthony De Mello were the other attendees. Gilligan expressed his 
            praise of Indian cricket, and promised to press for India's inclusion in the ICC, if all the promoters of cricket 
            in the land came together to establish a single controlling body.
