            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>
                At the outset, there is nothing significant about the year 1721, as far as India's 
                political history is concerned. Aurangzeb, the sixth of the great Mughals, had passed 
                away in 1707, and the Empire he and his forefathers had built, had started to disintegrate. 
                The Marathas were gaining in prominence, and in the process of knocking hard on the doors of
                Delhi. These were prominent happenings; what was peripheral was that 'merchants' from England 
                and France had established 'settlements' in select areas of the subcontinent, and were going 
                about their business of trade.<br><br>
        
                The sea-route being the sole link between them and their respective homelands, most of 
                these settlements were situated in the coastal areas of the Indian peninsula. <br>
            
                It was sometime in 1721 that a British ship dropped anchor off the coast of 
                Kutch in western India. The recreational activities the sailors indulged in on
                the coast elicited curious reactions from onlookers. One of the sailors, who
                answered to the name of Downing, recalled his time on the Kutch coast in his 
                memoirs thus: "We everyday diverted ourselves with playing cricket and other 
                exercises". <br>
                    
                As the merchants metamorphosed into rulers, they continued to demonstrate their
                recreational pursuits on Indian soil.The British army took on the English settlers
                in what was the first recorded cricket match in India in 1751.<br>
            

                The establishment of the Calcutta Cricket Club (what we know today as CC & FC) in 1792,
                was another watershed for the sport in the land. In fact, it is the second-oldest cricket
                club in the world, after the MCC (1787). <br>        

                Ten years after its inception, the CCC organized a match between its team and the Old Etonians.
                The highlight of the game was Old Etonian Robert Vansittart's hundred. It was the first 'recorded'
                century on Indian soil.That game was watched by the locals, as were other encounters that took place
                elsewhere. It was but natural that the locals sought to copy what the 'rulers' were doing. Recent evidence 
                suggests that members of the Indian army were among the first to take to the sport. The 'sepoys' of regiments
                based in Sylhet (now part of Bangladesh) were reported by a periodical of the time as being more energetic
                and cheerful cricketers than their European superiors. The latter did not mind this, and were in fact happy to engage 
                in matches against their subordinates.
                The Parsis were the first Indian civilian community to take to cricket. They set up the Oriental Cricket 
                Club in Mumbai in 1848. It did a premature death, but the community then established the Young Zoroastrians 
                Club in 1850.
