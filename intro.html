             Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for Mumbai 
             in domestic cricket and captains Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League as a right-handed batsman
             and an occasional right-arm off break bowler. He is the vice-captain of the Indian national team in 
             limited-overs formats.Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare campaigns. He 
             is the official Rhino Ambassador for WWF-India and is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of 
             Animals (PETA). He has worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of homeless 
             cats and dogs in India.
             <br>
             Sharma was born on 30 April 1987 in Bansod, Nagpur, Maharashtra. His mother Purnima Sharma is from 
             Visakhapatnam. His father Gurunath Sharma worked as a caretaker of a transport firm storehouse.
             Sharma was raised by his grandparents and uncles in Borivali because of his father's low income. He would 
            
             visit his parents, who lived in a single-room house in Dombivli, only during weekends. He has a younger
             brother, Vishal Sharma.Sharma joined a cricket camp in 1999 with his uncle's money. 
             <br><br>                
             In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made his Test debut at Eden Gardens in 
             Kolkata against the West Indies and scored 177, the second-best score on debut by an Indian behind Shikhar 
             Dhawan (187). He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his home ground, the Wankhede 
             Stadium in Mumbai. Having been out of the Test team since 2017–18, Sharma went on the 2018–19 tour of Australia 
             after he had earned a recall earlier. Chief selector M. S. K. Prasad said the reason for his recall was that his 
             natural game suited the bouncy Australian pitches. Sharma played in the first Test in Adelaide, scoring 37 and 
             1 in an Indian victory. During the first Test, he sustained a minor injury which saw him miss the second Test .
             He recovered for the Boxing Day third Test at Melbourne and scored 63 (not out) to help India total 443/7 and win
             the Test and the series.[25] After the third Test, Sharma had to return to India for the birth of his daughter. In 
             October 2019, in the third Test against South Africa, Sharma scored his 2,000th run and his first double century in
             Tests. He made 212 in the first innings of the match.
             <br><br>
             Sharma made his full international debut in a one-day match against Ireland in Belfast on 23 June 2007. This was 
             part of the 2007 Future Cup competition which also involved South Africa. He was number seven in the batting order 
             but did not bat as India won the game by 9 wickets. Sharma scored his maiden ODI half-century (52) against Pakistan 
             at Jaipur on 18 November 2007 and was selected for the Indian squad going to the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series in 
             Australia.[37][38] In that series, he scored 235 runs at an average of 33.57 with 2 fifties, including 66 in the 
             first final at Sydney when he partnered Sachin Tendulkar for most of India's successful run chase.[39][40] After 
             that, however, his ODI performances suffered a downturn and he lost his middle-order position to Suresh Raina. 
             Later, Virat Kohli took his position as the reserve batsman. In December 2009, following his triple century in the 
             Ranji Trophy, he was recalled to the ODI team for the tri-nations tournament in Bangladesh as Tendulkar opted to rest 
             in the series. Sharma scored his maiden ODI century (114) against Zimbabwe on 28 May 2010 and followed it up 
             with another century in the next match of the tri-series against Sri Lanka on 30 May 2010 by scoring 101 not out.
             <br><br>
             He had a run of poor form in South Africa just before the 2011 World Cup and as a consequence he was left out of 
             India's squad for the tournament. Sharma was recalled to the limited-overs squad for the tour of the West Indies 
             in June and July 2011.[45] In the first match at Queen's Park Oval, he scored 68 (not out) from 75 balls with three 
             fours and a six. In the third match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua, he scored a matching-winning 86 off 
             91 balls after India had been reduced to 92 for 6. Sharma had a disastrous loss of form in 2012 and scored only 168 
             runs in the whole calendar year at the very low average of 12.92 with just a single half-century. Even so, his captain 
             Mahendra Singh Dhoni, showed faith in him and his career was revived in 2013. Dhoni decided to move him up the batting 
             order to open the innings with Shikhar Dhawan in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. The pairing was a success and India won 
             the competition, defeating hosts England in the final. Sharma's good form continued and, later in the year against 
             Australia, he scored 141 (not out) in Jaipur. He followed that with 209 off 158 balls in Bangalore and established a 
             then world record for the most sixes (16) in a one-day international innings.[48] On 13 November 2014, playing against 
             Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, Sharma broke the world record for the highest score in a one-day international 
             innings with 264 from 173 deliveries. In December 2017, India's captain Virat Kohli was rested for the series against 
             Sri Lanka, in preparation for India's tour to South Africa, which began in the first week of January 2018. In his place,
             Sharma was named the Indian team captain for the first time in his career and India under his leadership won the series 
             2–1, their eighth consecutive series win since defeating Zimbabwe in June 2016. On 12 January 2019, in the opening 
             match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Sharma scored 133 but it was in vain as India lost by 34 runs. 
             It was his 22nd century in one-day internationals.[53] At Delhi on 13 March 2019, in the fifth and final match of a 
             home series against Australia, Sharma scored 56 including his 8,000th run in one-day internationals. It was his 200th 
             innings.[54] After India v/s West Indies 2nd ODI at Vizag, Sharma surpassed Mahendra Singh Dhoni's record. Sharma now 
             has 187 plus sixes in 116 innings to his name as compared to Dhoni's 186 in 208 innings at home.In 2019, he scored the 
             most runs in ODIs by any batsman, with 1490 runs.
